Since Header and Meals are done, now comes the Cart logic.
Here, if I click add to cart button, it shows increment quantity in Meals component,
Also in Cart button, it adds one, and plus in Cart modal i.e. checkout page also,
it should reflect the Click button change, so prop drilling can be the case.
That's why we go for React Context API to manage state across comp.'s properly.
